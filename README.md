# Lyme-disease-locations- 
In progress developing a Python-based tool that uses the News API and public health data to identify and map U.S. locations with reported Lyme disease activity. 
Saved links I extracted from a newspai to a txt file. Then removed duplicated information by converting my data into a set. 
Will add a scheduler to have my api run once daily 
Still currently
